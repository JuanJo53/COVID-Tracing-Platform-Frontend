Alrededor del 15% desarrollan una enfermedad grave y requieren oxígeno y el 5% llegan a un estado crítico y precisan cuidados intensivos.              Entre las complicaciones que pueden llevar a la muerte se encuentran la insuficiencia respiratoria, el síndrome de dificultad respiratoria aguda, la septicemia y el choque septicémico, la tromboembolia y/o la insuficiencia multiorgánica, incluidas las lesiones cardíacas, hepáticas y renales.                            Rara vez, los niños pueden manifestar un síndrome inflamatorio grave unas semanas después de la infección.                                                                ¿Quién corre mayor riesgo de presentar un cuadro grave de COVID-19?                            ¿Quién corre mayor riesgo de presentar un cuadro grave de COVID-19?                                                                            Las personas de más de 60 años y las que padecen afecciones médicas subyacentes, como hipertensión arterial, problemas cardíacos o pulmonares, diabetes, obesidad o cáncer, corren un mayor riesgo de presentar cuadros graves.               Sin embargo, cualquier persona, a cualquier edad, puede enfermar de COVID-19 y presentar un cuadro grave o morir.                                        ¿Tiene la COVID-19 efectos a largo plazo?                            ¿Tiene la COVID-19 efectos a largo plazo?                                        Algunas personas que han padecido la COVID-19, tanto si han necesitado atención hospitalaria como si no, siguen experimentando síntomas, entre ellos fatiga y diversos síntomas respiratorios y neurológicos.              En la OMS estamos trabajando con nuestra Red técnica mundial para la gestión clínica de la COVID-19, así como con investigadores y grupos de pacientes de todo el mundo, para diseñar y llevar a cabo estudios               que vayan más allá del estadio inicial agudo de la enfermedad, con el fin de determinar el porcentaje de pacientes que sufren efectos a largo plazo, el tiempo que persisten y la razón por la que se producen. Estos estudios se utilizarán para desarrollar nuevas orientaciones de cara a la atención de los pacientes.                                                                 ¿Cuándo debería hacerme una prueba de la COVID-19?                            ¿Cuándo debería hacerme una prueba de la COVID-19?                                                                            Todas las personas que presenten síntomas deben hacerse la prueba, en la medida de lo posible. Las personas que sean asintomáticas pero que hayan estado en contacto estrecho con alguien que esté o pueda estar infectado también pueden considerar la posibilidad de hacerse la prueba; consulte las directrices sanitarias locales y siga sus indicaciones.                Cuando una persona esté a la espera de los resultados de la prueba, debe permanecer aislada de los demás. Si la capacidad de realizar pruebas es limitada, las pruebas deberían reservarse en primer lugar para quienes corren mayor riesgo de infección, como el personal de salud, y las personas con mayor riesgo de presentar un cuadro grave, como las personas mayores, especialmente las que viven en residencias de mayores o en centros de atención de larga estancia.
